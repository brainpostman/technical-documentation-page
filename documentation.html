                    <code>static</code>
                    <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
                        The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect.
                        This is the default value.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>relative</code>
                    <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document,
                        and then offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right,
                        bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other
                        elements; thus, the space given for the element in the page layout is
                        the same as if position were static. This value creates a new stacking
                        context when the value of z-index is not auto. Its effect on table-*-group, table-row, table-column, table-cell, and table-caption elements is undefined.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>absolute</code>
                    <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space
                        is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned
                        relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise,
                        it is placed relative to the initial containing block. Its final
                        position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
                        This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index
                        is not auto. The margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not
                        collapse with other margins.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>fixed</code>
                    <p>The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space
                        is created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned
                        relative to the initial containing block established by the viewport,
                        except when one of its ancestors has a transform, perspective, or
                        filter property set to something other than none (see the CSS
                        Transforms Spec), or the will-change property is set to transform,
                        in which case that ancestor behaves as the containing block.
                        (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective and
                        filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final
                        position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
                        This value always creates a new stacking context. In printed documents,
                        the element is placed in the same position on every page.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>sticky</code>
                    <p>The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document,
                        and then offset relative to its nearest scrolling ancestor and
                        containing block (nearest block-level ancestor), including
                        table-related elements, based on the values of top, right, bottom,
                        and left. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements.
                        This value always creates a new stacking context. Note that a sticky
                        element "sticks" to its nearest ancestor that has a "scrolling mechanism" (created when overflow is hidden, scroll, auto, or overlay), even if that ancestor isn't the nearest actually scrolling ancestor.</p>

            <h3>Types of positioning</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A positioned element is an element whose computed position value is
                    either relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky. (In other words, it's
                    anything except static.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A relatively positioned element is an element whose computed position
                    value is relative. The top and bottom properties specify the vertical
                    offset from its normal position; the left and right properties specify
                    the horizontal offset.
                </li>
                <li>
                    An absolutely positioned element is an element whose computed position
                    value is absolute or fixed. The top, right, bottom, and left properties
                    specify offsets from the edges of the element's containing block.
                    (The containing block is the ancestor relative to which the element
                    is positioned.) If the element has margins, they are added to the offset.
                    The element establishes a new block formatting context (BFC) for
                    its contents.
                </li>
                <li>
                    A stickily positioned element is an element whose computed position
                    value is sticky. It's treated as relatively positioned until its
                    containing block crosses a specified threshold (such as setting top
                    to value other than auto) within its flow root (or the container it
                    scrolls within), at which point it is treated as "stuck" until meeting
                    the opposite edge of its containing block.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most of the time, absolutely positioned elements that have height and width
                set to auto are sized so as to fit their contents. However, non-replaced,
                absolutely positioned elements can be made to fill the available vertical
                space by specifying both top and bottom and leaving height unspecified (that
                is, auto). They can likewise be made to fill the available horizontal space
                by specifying both left and right and leaving width as auto.</p>

            <p>Except for the case just described (of absolutely positioned elements filling
                the available space):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If both top and bottom are specified (technically, not auto), top wins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If both left and right are specified, left wins when direction is ltr
                    (English, horizontal Japanese, etc.) and right wins when direction is
                    rtl (Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, etc.).
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Accessibility_concerns" class="main-section">
            <header><h2>Accessibility concerns</h2></header>
            <p>Ensure that elements positioned with an absolute or fixed value do not obscure
                other content when the page is zoomed to increase text size.</p>
            <h3>
                Performance & Accessibility
            </h3>
            <p>Scrolling elements containing fixed or sticky content can cause performance
                and accessibility issues. As a user scrolls, the browser must repaint the
                sticky or fixed content in a new location. Depending on the content needing
                to be repainted, the browser performance, and the device's processing speed,
                the browser may not be able to manage repaints at 60 fps, causing accessibility
                concerns for people with sensitivities and jank for everyone. One solution is
                to add will-change: transform to the positioned elements to render the element
                in its own layer, improving repaint speed and therefore improving performance
                and accessibility.</p>
